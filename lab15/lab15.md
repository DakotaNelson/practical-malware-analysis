Lab 15-1
========

1. This sample uses jump instructions with constant conditions to obfuscate the disassembly.

2. The disassembler is tricked into assemblinhg `call` instructions into strange places.

3. The technique is used 5 times.

4. `pdq` is the code.


Lab 15-2
========

1. The program initially requests `http://practicalmalwareanalysis.com/bamboo.html`.

2. The program takes the computer's hostname and increments each character by 1 to create the User-Agent.

3. The program searches for any text between `Bamboo::` and `::` in the page.o

4. The text found (see previous question) is then used as a URL. The program downloads what it finds at that URL, names it `Account Summary.xls.exe`, then launches it.


Lab 15-3
========

1. The return pointer from the `main` function is changed, causing IDA to miss the malicious code.

2. The code downloads and executes the data it finds at a set URL.

3. `http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/tt.html`

4. `spoolsrv.exe`
