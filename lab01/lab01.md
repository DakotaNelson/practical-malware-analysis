Lab 1-1
=======

  1. `Lab01-01.dll` is marked malicious for 24/56 engines; `Lab01-01.exe` is for 29/55 engines.

  2. `Lab01-01.dll` was compiled on `2010-12-19 16:16:38`; `Lab01-01.exe` on `2010-12-19 16:16:19`.

  3. VirusTotal indicates that `Lab01-01.dll` uses `Armadillo v1.xx - v2.xx`, while `Lab01-01.exe` uses `Armadillo v1.7.1`.

  4. `Lab01-01.dll` imports `socket`, `inet_addr`, and other internet functions, suggesting it connects to the internet. `Lab01-01.exe` imports `FindFirstFileA`, `CopyFileA`, `CreateFileA`, and other file handling functions that suggest it manipulates files.

  5. Each file contains several fairly unique strings that could be used as host-based indicators; `Lab01-01.dll` contains `127.26.152.13` (obviously useful as a network indicator as well), while `Lab01-01.exe` contains `WARNING_THIS_WILL_DESTROY_YOUR_MACHINE`.

  6. `Lab01-01.dll` contains:

    ```
    hello
    127.26.152.13
    SADFHUHF
    ```

    Which suggests to me that perhaps the message `hello` is sent to `127.26.152.13` - usable as a network indicator.

  7. `Lab01-01.exe` contains some odd strings:
    ```
    kerne132.dll
    kernel32.dll
    .exe
    C:\*
    C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll
    Kernel32.
    Lab01-01.dll
    C:\Windows\System32\Kernel32.dll
    WARNING_THIS_WILL_DESTROY_YOUR_MACHINE
    ```

    Along with the file handling functions imported, this suggests to me that this sample will delete at least `kerne132.dll` (interesting typo in several cases?) if not `C:\*` entirely. On the other hand, at least they warn you first.

    As noted in (6), `Lab01-01.dll` contains:

    ```
    hello
    127.26.152.13
    SADFHUHF
    ```

    Which suggests to me that perhaps the message `hello` is sent to `127.26.152.13`. Given the set of imports shown below, the sample appears to have receive functionality as well, which could possibly implement full command and control (or could be a simple phone home).

    ```
    socket
    closesocket
    inet_addr
    send
    WSACleanup
    WSAStartup
    connect
    shutdown
    htons
    recv
    ```


Lab 1-2
=======

 1. `Lab01-02.exe` matches 36 engines on VirusTotal.

 2. The file appears to be packed with the UPX packer - as reported by VirusTotal. It's also telling that the PE sections are "UPX0" through "UPX2".

  3. The file imports `InternetOpenA` from `WININET.dll`, as well as `CreateServiceA` from `ADVAPI32.dll`, which suggests that it spawns a service with Internet access. Since it also imports `GetProcAddress` and `LoadLibraryA`, it could load additional libraries for more functionality. (the text `InternetOpenUrlA` appears in the body of the executable, suggesting it is loaded dynamically)

  4. The file contains several interesting strings, including `http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com` and `Internet Explorer 8.0`, the latter of which seems likely to be a user agent string used when accessing the earlier domain. The string `MalService` also appears (twice), suggesting (in tandem with the import of `CreateServiceA`) that this file creates a service with that name.


Lab 1-3
=======

  1. VirusTotal matches this sample on a huge variety of malware families; the most common seems to be `Packer.FSG.A`.

  2. VirusTotal reports that the file appears to be packed with the `FSG` packer. PEiD reports `FSG 1.0 -> dulek/xt`. It cannot be unpacked using simple static analysis.

  3. `Lab01-03.exe` has a variety of interesting imports, including:

  ```
  CreateRemoteThread
  CreateDirectory
  CreateFile
  FindFirstFile
  LoadLibrary
  CreateNamedPipe
  CreatePipe
  IsDebuggerPresent
  Beep
  ```

  4. Without unpacking, there are very few indicators to find here. Using some of the imports as clues, it may be worthwhile to watch for a process that spawns threads and creates pipes, but that's not a particularly unique signature.


Lab 1-4
=======

  1. 48 VirusTotal engines match (out of 56).

  2. VirusTotal reports the file is packed with `Armadilo v1.7`. PEiD, however, reports the file is not packed - bot due to entropy and a deep scan.

  3. PEview reports that the file was compiled on `2019/08/30 Fri 22:26:59 UTC` - obviously faked.

  4. This file has a huge number of imports, including:

  ```
  LoadLibrary
  WriteFile
  DeleteFile
  CreateRemoteThread
  OpenThread
  CreatePipe
  CreateNamedPipe
  ConnectNamedPipe
  GetCommandLine
  ExpandEnvironmentStrings
  GetEnvironmentVariable
  IsDebuggerPresent
  Beep
  OpenProcessToken
  CreateService
  ControlService
  StartService
  RegLoadKey
  RegOpenCurrentUser
  DelayLoadFailureHook
  NsiConnectToServer
  CryptDecrypt
  CryptEncrypt
  WinVerifyTrust
  LogonUser
  CreateBitmap
  GetClipBox
  < various other GUI functions >
  PlaySound
  URLDownloadToCacheFile
  URLDownloadToFile
  OpenProcessToken
  ```

  5. Host indicators include the strings `\system32\wupdmgr.exe` (which, paired with some of the imports, suggests that this file calls out to that executable), `<not real>`, `\winup.exe` (again, likely calls out), and several dlls that are likely dynamicall imported - `urlmon.dll` and `psapi.dll` among them.

  Network-based indicators include the URL `http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/updater.exe`.

  6. The only resource available with ResourceHacker is a binary file containing the text of the program.
